# planning-with-files: plan-doctor — one-pass self-check for the mechanisms
# that fail silently. Run from the project root:
#
#   sh scripts/plan-doctor.sh
#
# Answers:
#   - does plan resolution work here, and which plan wins?
#   - does hook injection actually emit plan context?
#   - is the canonicalizer producing comparable paths? (Windows-native
#     coreutils emit C:\-style output; pwf versions before v3.6.0 went
#     silently dark on such machines)
#   - is the plan attested, and is the attestation file where hooks look?
#   - which install surfaces exist on this machine?
#   - what does one hook fire cost in wall-clock?
#
# Diagnostic only. Writes nothing except inject-plan.sh's own SHA cache.
# Always exits 0.
